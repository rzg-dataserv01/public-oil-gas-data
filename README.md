# Public Oil & Gas Data
=========================

This forked list adds to the great sources (orginially compiled by derrickturk) of publicly available (and free) oil & gas data collected by numerous regulatory (federal, state, etc.) agencies. Datasets include: oil & gas well production, well logs, well completions, geology, and more.

*Disclaimer: Data quality varies for each data source and will depend on each agencies rules, regulations for what data is to be submitted and the data QA/QC efforts performed.* 

Pull requests welcome!
