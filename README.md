# Public US Oil & Gas Data
============================

### This forked list adds to the great sources (originally compiled by derrickturk) of publicly available (and free) oil & gas data collected by numerous regulatory (federal, state, etc.) agencies. Datasets include: oil & gas well production, well logs, well completions, geology, and more.

*Disclaimer: Data quality varies for each data source and will depend on each agencies rules, regulations for what data is to be submitted and the data QA/QC efforts performed.* 

* State Regulatory Agencies - Many state regulatory agencies in the U.S. maintain online databases and query systems for oil and gas well data. These can be tedious to access by hand, but offer a rich source of potentially-scrapable data.

* FracFocus - FracFocus.org is a site for voluntary (except in some states) disclosure of chemicals, additives, and volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. Data quality and coverage is hit-and-miss, but it's one of the few public sources for detailed frac-design data.
http://fracfocus.org/. [outdated-keep?] An environmental group carried out some heavy data munging to get the FracFocus set (up to May 2013) into a more usable form. http://frack.skytruth.org/fracking-chemical-database
