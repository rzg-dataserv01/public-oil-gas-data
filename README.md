# Public Oil & Gas Data
=========================

### This forked list adds to the great sources (originally compiled by derrickturk) of publicly available (and free) oil & gas data collected by numerous regulatory (federal, state, etc.) agencies. Datasets include: oil & gas well production, well logs, well completions, geology, and more.

*Disclaimer: Data quality varies for each data source and will depend on each agencies rules, regulations for what data is to be submitted and the data QA/QC efforts performed.* 

* State Regulatory Agencies - Many state regulatory agencies in the U.S. maintain online databases and query systems for oil and gas well data. These can be tedious to access by hand, but offer a rich source of potentially-scrapable data.
  * Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (includes log data) (http://doa.alaska.gov/ogc/)
  * California Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dog/Pages/Index.aspx)
  * Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (http://cogcc.state.co.us/)
  * Oklahoma Corporation Commission (http://www.occeweb.com/og/oghome.htm)
  * Texas Railroad Commission (http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/)
  * Wyoming Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (http://wogcc.state.wy.us/)

* FracFocus - FracFocus.org is a site for voluntary (except in some states) disclosure of chemicals, additives, and volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. Data quality and coverage is hit-and-miss, but it's one of the few public sources for detailed frac-design data.
http://fracfocus.org/. [outdated-keep?] An environmental group carried out some heavy data munging to get the FracFocus set (up to May 2013) into a more usable form. http://frack.skytruth.org/fracking-chemical-database

* UT Lands - The University of Texas system holds land and mineral rights to large areas in West Texas. This site allows access to production data, maps, and digitized well logs for wells on these lands.

* Public Mapping & GIS Data
  * USGS National Map Viewer - Download various publicly-available topo, etc. maps.
